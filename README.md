Getting started
---------------
Download [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/) for Mac or Windows. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) will be automatically installed. I recommend version 4.2 for Docker desktop. 

Run in this directory:
```
docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```
The app will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
